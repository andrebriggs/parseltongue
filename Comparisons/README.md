# Comparison Metrics

## Docker vs Functions Docker

This repository compares the container image sizes generated by a dockerized forecasting app accessing Blob Storage using Azure Python Blob Storage SDK and triggered through HTTP using Python Flask library vs the same forecasting app with a docker container generated by Azure Functions accessing blob through bindings and using HttpTrigger from the Python functions programming model.

Compare docker image sizes generated by this code vs the code in https://github.com/priyaananthasankar/parseltongue/tree/master/PyFunctionsOnACI/ForecastingApp

### Observations

Containerized Docker without Functions: `1.32 GB` (Flask + Azure Blob Storage SDK for Python + common libraries)

Containerized Docker with Functions Image Size: `2.14 GB` (HttpTrigger, Blob I/O Binding + common libraries) 
(remove about 400MB for virtual environment, still significant difference)
