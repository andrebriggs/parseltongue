# Comparison Metrics

## Docker vs Functions Docker

This repository compares the container image sizes generated by a dockerized forecasting app accessing Blob Storage using Azure Python Blob Storage SDK and triggered through HTTP using Python Flask library vs the same forecasting app with a docker container generated by Azure Functions accessing blob through bindings and using HttpTrigger from the Python functions programming model.

### Observations

Containerized Docker without Functions: `1.32 GB` (Flask + Azure Blob Storage SDK for Python + common libraries)

Containerized Docker with Functions Image Size: `2.14 GB` (HttpTrigger, Blob I/O Binding + common libraries)
