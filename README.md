This repository contains samples built with Azure Functions on Python (private preview) to infer/predict from ML models

#Camping Gear
Predict the gear type of an image: e.g., boots, gloves, harness, jacket etc, given a model that is trained using Keras on 
multiple camping images.

#LDA Modeling
Topic model Jane Austen's books or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books from Gutenberg database using Gensim and NTLK libraries
and have a bit of fun exploring main characters via PyLDAVis

#InceptionV3
Sample code to demonstrate InceptionV3 model loading through Tensorflow libraries
